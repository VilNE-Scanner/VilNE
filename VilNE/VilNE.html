            VilNE - Victim Initiated Local Network Enumerator/Exploiter (Pronounced Villainy) is a tool to show how a
            malicious webpage can:
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                Reveal to an adversary the services within the network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Blindly attempt to exploit internal services - similar to how botnets propagate by attacking vulnerable
                services exposed to the internet.
              </li>
              <br /><br />
              <h4>The contraints</h4>
              <br />
              Modern Browsers have several protections built in to protect internal services:
              <li>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Restrictions - A big topic, but for our purposes a webpage can't
                view content from another webpage hosted elsewhere that hasn't been explicitly permitted by it. E.g.
                www.bob.com/javascript.js can't read www.alice.com/page.html. There are other
                restrictions around what options are available without what is called a 'Pre flight request', we can't
                change the user agent for example.
              </li>
              <li>Mixed Content Restrictions - Again a big topic, but for our purposes an HTTPS page can't even request
                resources from an HTTP location. (does not apply the other away around)
              </li>
              <br />
              So by working within these parameters, we are still able to send GET and POST requests to any IP address
              so long as the scanner itself is on HTTP and not HTTPs. We only have to look at what unpatched services
              are vulnerable to very simple exploits on the wider internet to estimate how big a problem this
              will be internally.
              <br /><br />
              <h4>
                How the tool works
              </h4>
              <br />
              <li>
                Timing the responses to know what's up - As a rule, a port that is up but CORS restricted will respond
                much quicker than one which is not there and times-out. We can therefore use this to determine what IP
                and ports are online.
                There does seem to be a difference in the network stacks in Operating Systems. When scanned on some
                operating systems such as Linux, an IP that is up but filtering a port will cause it to fail in an
                indistinguishable amount of time from a CORS error. This means that the tool can
                potentially identify IP addresses which are up but NOT offering web services - arguably more valuable
                from a reconnaisance point of view.
              </li>
              <li>
                Currently, given a set of Class B address (e.g. 192.168.0.0/16) - the tool will try every class C to see
                if a host is available on the first IP on port 80, e.g. 192.168.1.1. The logic is that most subnets have
                a device such as a router on the first IP - although this does admittedly potentially restrict it.
                <br />
                I will consider adjusting this, although ultimately this is a proof of concept and not an attack
                framework.
              </li>
              <li>
                The tool then scans those subnets for the ports you've selected - on Windows the results are more
                accurate, but on Linux it may reveal hosts which are online but filtering.
              </li>
              <li>
                If 'Attack Hosts' is enabled then when it scans the hosts it will attempt a benign GET and POST exploit.
                In reality this could be a large bank of attacks for common vulnerabilities.
              </li>

          </b-tab>
          <b-tab title="Why this is a problem">
            <li>
              Wide spread scanning of the internet for vulnerable servers is known about, and relatively well protected.
              These are often simple Remote Code Execution exploits within GET or POST parameters.
            </li><br />
            <li>
              Internal services are often not patched as urgently, but also things which wouldn't typically be available
              online. How many times have we heard "It's not exposed to the internet, no problem!"
            </li><br />
            <li>
              This tool demonstrates that there's very little to stop someone's browser doing the very same above
              attacks on this soft underbelly of the network.
            </li><br />
            <li>
              A compromised internal service is likely to be outside of any DMZ and may afford an attacker far easier
              lateral movement ability.
            </li><br />
            <li>
              An attack like this could easily be conducted from a malicious redirect on a webpage such as in a
              waterhole
              attack, or a could herald a return to the Exploit Kit days.
            </li><br />
            <li>
              <i>
                VilNE only demonstrates the high level concept, there are many other things I can imagine it could do,
                such as trying common internal hostnames instead of IP addresses either by brute force or word lists.
              </i>
            </li>


          </b-tab>
          <b-tab title="Detection and Prevention">


            <li><b>Patch</b> - An obvious one - while not preventing the above scanning, it would at least prevent the
              botnet-like drive by exploitation.</li><br />
            <li><b>Browsers</b> - Bulk scanning such as what this tool does could be restricted by browsers, by perhaps
              rate limiting or placing restrictions on unique IP/Port attempts, or failure codes across a series of
              hosts.</li><br />
            <li><b>Browsers</b> - Browsers could maybe prevent parameters being sent until CORS is resolved, such as
              when doing pre-flight checks.</li><br />
            <li><b>NDR</b> - This tool has been tested against Vectra Detect, which correctly detects the behaviour as
              scanning activity.</li><br />
            <li><b>EDR</b> - I haven't tested this on any EDR tools, however given the noise this would generate I would
              imagine it may come under existing rules for blocking of port scans.</li><br />
            <li><b>Web applications</b> - As well as patch, ensure all applicable CORS + CSRF protections are in place
              and tested.</li><br />
            <li><b>Proxy/Enforcing WAF/IDS</b> - Enforce ALL traffic connecting to a Web application to utilise security
              platforms such as a WAF with up-to-date rules. Implement least-privilege where possible so that only
              authorised users/IPs can connect.</li><br />
            <li><b>Port Scan detection rules</b> - While within a subnet, port scanning detections using firewall logs
              is more of a challenge, however a rule which looks for a single internal host attempting the same port on
              many internal destinations should be considered.</li><br />
            <li><b>IDS/WAF/Proxy logs</b> - By enforcing users into a path via IDS/WAF/Proxy in order to connect to a
              web application, you can ensure that detection opportunities are maximised. If you see an internal IP
              trigger a rule, this warrants attention!</li><br />
